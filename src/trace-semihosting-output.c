// Semihosting is the other output channel that can be used for the trace
// messages. It comes in two flavours: STDOUT and DEBUG. The STDOUT channel
// is the equivalent of the stdout in POSIX and in most cases it is forwarded
// to the GDB server stdout stream. The debug channel is a separate
// channel. STDOUT is buffered, so nothing is displayed until a \n;
// DEBUG is not buffered, but can be slow.
//
// Choosing between semihosting stdout and debug depends on the capabilities
// of your GDB server, and also on specific needs. It is recommended to test
// DEBUG first, and if too slow, try STDOUT.
//
// The JLink GDB server fully support semihosting, and both configurations
// are available; to activate it, use "monitor semihosting enable" or check
// the corresponding button in the JLink Debugging plug-in.
// In OpenOCD, support for semihosting can be enabled using
// "monitor arm semihosting enable".
//
// Note: Applications built with semihosting output active normally cannot
// be executed without the debugger connected and active, since they use
// BKPT to communicate with the host. However, with a carefully written
// HardFault_Handler, the semihosting BKPT calls can be processed, making
// possible to run semihosting applications as standalone, without being
// terminated with hardware faults.
